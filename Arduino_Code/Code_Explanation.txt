  📌 Code Explanation (Summary)
-------------------------------
  1. Libraries:
     - OneWire + DallasTemperature used to read from DS18B20 sensor.

  2. Pin Setup:
     - Sensor at pin 2, relay at pin 3.
     - Pump turns ON if temperature >= 50°C.

  3. setup():
     - Starts serial communication.
     - Sets relay pin as output.
     - Initializes the temperature sensor.

  4. loop():
     - Reads temperature from sensor.
     - Prints it on Serial Monitor.
     - If temp >= threshold → Pump ON.
       Else → Pump OFF.
     - Waits 1 second before repeating.

  ⚙️ Input: Temperature sensor reading
  ⚙️ Output: Relay ON/OFF → Controls pump
